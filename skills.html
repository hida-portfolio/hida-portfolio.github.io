                    <p align="center"> I try to pick up a lot of hobbies but end up dropping them sooner or later. I used to  journel every single day for 2-3 years and then one day I was so sick of writing I stopped. I also tried to crochet and then stopped, and same thing with bracelet making. But there is one thing I never dropped and probably will never will; cooking.</p>

                  <h3 align="center"> <hr>Cooking<hr></h3>
                  <p align="center"> I learned cooking when I was 12. I started cooking because I found my mom really inspiring in the kitfchen cooking food for me and my family and it was also because I wanted to start making food instead of buying them. It started with a lot of failed unedible "food", but soon I mastered some recipes, like tom yum ramen, rice cakes, ube cheese bread, stired fried rice & vegitables, tiramisu and many more. </p>

                  <h3 align="center"> <hr>Phtography<hr></h3>
                  <p align="center"> I strarted taking pictures as soon as I got a phone, I always wanted to take pictures with my eyes as a kid so I can have a photo of a beutiful memory pictured in my brain, but when I got a phone my storage was always full no matter how big of a storage I had. I taught myself how to take pictures, also because my sister forced me to take picture of her everywhere we go, so it's a skill I must master so she'd be happy. I want a camera or camcorder too but I need to save up for that.</p>

                  <h3 align="center"> <hr>Memorization<hr></h3>
                  <p align="center"> I am good at remmembering details, espicially things people forget easily. I am not necessarily good at memorizing words but remmembering pictures. I would remind my older sister about what happened when she was little. And what happened years ago with detail, but when it comes to memorizing in another language like memorizing for a test in my Arabic school I am really bad at that. If I pay full attention, sure, but if I am not fully motivated to do something, I cannot do it, even if someone forces me to.</p>
